# CALCY: Python Calculator Program with Text-to-Speech

CALCY is a Python-based calculator that provides a comprehensive set of mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to compound interest calculations. It also includes text-to-speech functionality to audibly relay results and instructions, enhancing the user experience.

## Features
- **Basic Math Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Advanced Math Calculations**: Power calculations, square root, compound interest, distance conversions (meters to kilometers and vice versa), and more.
- **Utility Functions**: 
  - **Odd/Even Checker**: Determines if a number is odd or even.
  - **Square Calculator**: Computes the square of a given number.
  - **Multiplication Table**: Generates multiplication tables up to 10.
  - **Mole Calculator**: Calculates moles based on mass and molar mass.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: `speakfunc.py` provides audible feedback for selected operations using `pyttsx3`.

## Project Files
- **calcy2.py**: Main program that interacts with users, provides operation prompts, and calls `speakfunc.py` functions for text-to-speech output.
- **speakfunc.py**: Handles text-to-speech functionality through the `pyttsx3` library, using two voices for variety in response output.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, instructions for installation and usage.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all necessary Python libraries for smooth operation, including `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech.
